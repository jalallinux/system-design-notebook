# Communication Rules

- **Always respond in English** - All responses, explanations, and interactions must be in English regardless of the user's input language
- Write all markdown files and documentation in English
- **Documentation Location** - All system design topic documentation files must be placed in the `/docs` directory at the repository root
- **Category-Based Directory Structure** - Each documentation file must be placed in a subcategory folder under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/fundamentals/`, `docs/distributed-transactions/`, `docs/messaging/`). When adding a new topic, place it in an existing category or create a new category folder if none fits. Never place documentation files directly in `docs/` without a category subdirectory
- **Persian Translation Synchronization** - For every markdown documentation file created in `/docs`, also create a `.fa.md` file (Persian translation) in the same directory and keep it synchronized with the original English file. For example, if you create `docs/fundamentals/topic.md`, also create `docs/fundamentals/topic.fa.md` with the Persian translation
- **README Table of Contents Update** - Whenever a new documentation file is added to `/docs`, update both `README.md` and `README.fa.md` to include links to the new content in the table of contents. Add entries for both English (.md) and Persian (.fa.md) versions with proper `docs/<category>/` path prefix. Maintain consistent formatting in the table
- **Learning Priority Ordering** - Topics in the README table of contents must be ordered by learning priority, not by creation date. Foundational concepts (e.g., CAP Theorem) come first, followed by patterns that build on them. When adding a new topic, re-evaluate the learning order and insert it at the appropriate position so readers can build a proper mental model progressively
- **Inline Cross-Linking** - When writing or updating a documentation file, add inline links to other existing docs wherever their topic is mentioned in the text. For example, if a document mentions "CAP Theorem" and a CAP Theorem doc already exists, link to it at the point of mention (e.g., `[CAP Theorem](../fundamentals/cap-theorem.md)`). Use relative paths between docs. Apply the same cross-linking in the corresponding `.fa.md` file. This helps readers navigate between related concepts naturally
