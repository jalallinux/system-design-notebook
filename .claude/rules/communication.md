# Communication Rules

- **Always respond in English** - All responses, explanations, and interactions must be in English regardless of the user's input language
- Write all markdown files and documentation in English
- **Persian Translation Synchronization** - For every markdown documentation file created, also create a `.fa.md` file (Persian translation) and keep it synchronized with the original English file. For example, if you create `topic.md`, also create `topic.fa.md` with the Persian translation
- **README Table of Contents Update** - Whenever a new documentation file is added, update both `README.md` and `README.fa.md` to include links to the new content in the table of contents. Add entries for both English (.md) and Persian (.fa.md) versions. Maintain proper numbering and consistent formatting in the table
