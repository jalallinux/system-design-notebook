# Communication Rules

- **Always respond in English** - All responses, explanations, and interactions must be in English regardless of the user's input language
- Write all markdown files and documentation in English
- **Documentation Location** - All system design topic documentation files must be placed in the `/docs` directory at the repository root
- **Persian Translation Synchronization** - For every markdown documentation file created in `/docs`, also create a `.fa.md` file (Persian translation) in the same directory and keep it synchronized with the original English file. For example, if you create `docs/topic.md`, also create `docs/topic.fa.md` with the Persian translation
- **README Table of Contents Update** - Whenever a new documentation file is added to `/docs`, update both `README.md` and `README.fa.md` to include links to the new content in the table of contents. Add entries for both English (.md) and Persian (.fa.md) versions with proper `docs/` path prefix. Maintain proper numbering and consistent formatting in the table
